Updated 2026-10-10. Desktop/server scope; Android settings are unchanged.

The Management page groups every desktop destination into Models & inference,
Devices & clusters, Agents & integrations, Security & access, Runtime & operations,
Workspace & services, and Preferences & help. Basic mode has a curated daily-use
menu; Advanced adds development and pending port records. Neither mode changes
permissions. Any nonempty menu search examines all categories, including advanced
and unavailable features, with status labels.

The header's Search button opens Global search. Scope filters cover all local
results, settings/features, this session's chat, saved models and saved device
addresses. Multi-word queries match across title/content; results have highlighted
snippets and open their management page. Chat results return to the current chat
with its filter applied. Sources and results are bounded; failed local registry
reads are reported. Refresh reloads model/device references. No bearer keys,
weights, other chats, arbitrary files or remote device settings are indexed.

Web search requires the panel's off-by-default browser switch and a separate
human Search web click. Only the entered query goes to DuckDuckGo in the OS
browser. This is a browser handoff, not retrieved articles, RAG ingestion, agent
browsing or permission to search another device. Those adapters are tracked as
pending. Offline global search works without this switch or model host access.
