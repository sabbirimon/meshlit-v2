# Meshlit desktop Studio implementation plan

Updated 2026-10-10. Scope: desktop only; preserve Android's existing starter,
inference mechanism, UI and data. This document distinguishes the current Intel
offline installer work from future milestones; it does not claim feature parity.

## Repository review and reuse

LM Studio's desktop application is proprietary. Its published interfaces can be
used, but its app code/assets are not available for copying under the SDK licences.
Build an original Compose UI with comparable workflow, thin headers and minimal
padding. Preserve Meshlit branding, themes, accessibility and user controls.

| Project | Checked licence/state | Intended use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [lmstudio-js](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio-js) | MIT | Optional integration for an owner-installed LM Studio host; Kotlin REST first, SDK bridge only if needed |
| [lms](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lms) | MIT, built inside JS monorepo | CLI lifecycle reference; not an independent inference engine |
| [lmstudio-python](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio-python) | MIT | Optional host automation, not required Python inside every desktop install |
| [mlx-engine](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/mlx-engine) | MIT; Python dependencies separate | Later Apple Silicon backend; unavailable on Intel, no silent CPU substitution |
| LM Studio model-catalog/configs | Apache-2.0/MIT, archived | Schema/design references, not a live model availability source |
| [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) | MIT | Explicit native API adapter for installed Ollama; later reviewed optional runtime packaging |
| [Jan](https://github.com/janhq/jan/blob/main/LICENSE) | Current root Apache-2.0 | Local/cloud workspace and assistant workflow reference; preserve licence/attribution for any copied component |
| [AnythingLLM](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm) | MIT, dependencies separate | Persistent document/workspace/RAG patterns; selectively reuse reviewed components rather than embedding its whole app |
| LM Studio office-document-processor-sources | MPL-2.0 modifications; mixed upstream/font licences | Separate optional document service only after component/source-obligation review |

The supplied comparison was outdated: Ollama now has a desktop chat app; Jan's
current root licence says Apache-2.0. Pin and review specific versions before actual
reuse. No LM Studio/Ollama/Jan/AnythingLLM code is imported merely by this plan.

## Architecture

Keep the Compose/JVM desktop shell. Use separate interfaces for `ModelCatalog`,
`ModelStore`, `DownloadManager`, `InferenceBackend`, `ConversationStore`,
`DocumentIndex`, `ToolPolicy` and `LocalApiService`. Each backend reports its own
supported model formats, operations and real metrics. Model configuration and
credentials bind to the selected backend; switching cannot leak history/keys.

Backend choices: bundled llama.cpp CPU, optional qualified GPU backend, existing
Ollama, existing LM Studio, generic authenticated host, Meshlit phone/cluster and
later MLX on Apple Silicon. Model file sharing and task routing are separate from
genuine multi-node layer execution; remote hosts are not pooled RAM by default.

## Sequential milestones and acceptance

1. **Offline Intel installer foundation (in progress).** Bundle verified Qwen2.5
   1.5B Instruct Q4_K_M (~1.12 GB), portable Java and CPU engine. Load/unload,
   local GGUF selection, authenticated loopback and full close/Stop lifecycle.
   Qualify real generation and native token usage from both DMG and PKG payloads.
   No model binary in Git; publish checksummed preview assets and licence/source
   material. Android stays unchanged. This is not full model-library management.
2. **Model library and discovery.** Original sidebar: Chat, Discover, My Models,
   Workspaces, Developer, Nodes, Settings; Experimental Labs separate. Top model
   selector, actual loading/download indicators, compact settings inspector.
   Hugging Face search/direct repo links, quantization/size/licence/capability
   cards, revision-pinned downloads, pause/resume/cancel with ETag validation,
   SHA-256 before atomic activation, selected storage root, disk-space admission,
   file reuse/import/delete with references and explicit confirmation. Private or
   gated models require legitimate user access; no credential leaks or bypasses.
3. **Inference controls and Ollama/LM Studio adapters.** Temperature, top-p/k,
   repeat penalty, seed, system presets, output/context limits, threads, qualified
   GPU layers and KV-cache options only where actually supported. Ollama native
   tags/show/pull/create/chat/ps plus keep_alive unload; LM Studio documented
   discovery/load/unload/download APIs with version capability checks. Never claim
   importing an SDK supplies its proprietary engine. Meshlit auto/manual loading
   and configurable idle unload respect active requests, pinned models and RAM.
   Verify decode rate from native token counts/durations separately from total
   request latency. No silent switch to cloud or another model on failure.
4. **Durable chats and document workspaces.** Local encrypted-at-rest sessions,
   search/export/branch/retry, per-workspace system settings, attachments, streaming
   Markdown/code/tables and model comparisons. Local chunking/indexing, real
   embedding backend selection, bounded retrieval and exact document citations;
   provenance, access and index deletion propagate. PDF/Office processing is an
   optional isolated component, not fabricated plain-text extraction. Establish
   adversarial-document and missing-source tests before shipping RAG claims.
5. **Developer and agent workspace.** Meshlit-owned CLI plus OpenAI-compatible
   API, real metrics, request cancellation, client token creation/revocation and
   quotas. Loopback default; authenticated TLS/grants for LAN/Internet. Optional
   MCP, reviewed tool calls, bounded task plans, file/SSH/workspace scopes, audit
   and Stop. Experimental remote actions/sandbox/VM remain separate from Core;
   neither local inference nor an imported model grants execution permissions.
6. **Qualification and extended devices.** Native Intel/Apple Silicon Mac,
   Windows x64 and Linux x64 packages tested separately. MLX only on actual
   Apple Silicon hardware; CUDA/ROCm/Vulkan/NPU features only with qualified
   drivers/devices. Test low RAM/disk, crash recovery, stale callbacks, corrupt
   models, network loss and revoked grants. Signing/notarization, dependency audit,
   clean-target installation and reproducible builds precede production claims.

Keep optional adapters/dependencies lazy to limit disk space. Never clone whole
projects or duplicate model weights just to display UI controls. Each milestone
ships only working controls, with unsupported features explicitly unavailable.
