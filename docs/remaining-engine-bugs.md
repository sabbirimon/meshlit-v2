# Remaining model-engine correctness gates

Updated 2026-10-07. Real bundled generation now passes on the API35 x86_64
emulator; this document records unresolved correctness work, not fake failures.

## Stream accounting corrected; SDK native usage still unavailable

The app no longer counts text deltas as tokens or truncates generation after a
number of callbacks. Native max_tokens/stop options bound generation. Missing
terminal completion fails, and unavailable usage is null in result/UI/wire types.

Pinned RunAnywhere 0.20.12 final metadata still reports 3 completion tokens for
`Hello, hello, hello.`, previously measured as 6 tokens by its native backend.
Its public stream result does not establish whether counts are measured or
estimated. Those SDK usage figures are suppressed; do not use them for billing
or native throughput. A future SDK change must expose measured counters with
provenance and agree with actual backend evidence before this gate is removed.

The standalone native adapter reads tokens_predicted, tokens_evaluated,
timings.cache_n and decode throughput from the native completion response.
Context/path checks and real native checkpoint reuse now have emulator evidence.
Read `native-checkpoints.md` and the latest PROGRESS entry.

## Physical-device and resource gates

- Real Android generation currently has emulator evidence; physical-phone
  boot/load/generate/unload, thermal, battery and low-memory tests remain.
- Native two-worker proof is desktop-only. Genuine oversized-model execution
  across physical phones remains a separate required gate.
- Compatible VLM/native speech model availability and real capture/feed inference
  must be tested before reporting media analysis as functional on a given device.
- SDK-managed context and unsupported acceleration controls must remain explicit;
  a metadata training limit is not an applied runtime context or usable NPU.
- Replicated journals, fenced claims, portable KV and automatic restart are
  future implementations; current local job persistence is insufficient.

See PROGRESS.md and the layer/recovery plan for the broader acceptance sequence.

## SDK development telemetry attempts observed (2026-10-07)

A real bundled chat generation during UI validation logged attempted POSTs to
`https://dev.runanywhere.local/api/v2/sdk/telemetry/llm`, ending in DNS failures.
The inference adapter's comment that DEVELOPMENT disables telemetry is contradicted
by this runtime observation. Evidence is in
`../../meshlit-validation/reference-ui/sdk-telemetry-observation.log` (PID 10603).
No successful transmission or payload contents were established. Do not describe
this SDK configuration as a demonstrated zero-network/telemetry opt-out.

Follow-up: review the exact 0.20.12 native HTTP/event integration; implement a
supported, default-disabled telemetry boundary independent of environment URLs;
then prove generation/download/import still work and no telemetry HTTP callback
or connection is attempted. The bridge lifecycle in newer cloned source is an
internal API and differs from the pinned AAR; do not patch it blindly or use a
broken URL as an opt-out. Native standalone CPU inference is a separate backend.
This UI continuation records the bug; it does not claim to have corrected it.

## Legacy capture connectivity (2026-10-07)

The built-in VPN capture read TUN packets without forwarding and could interrupt
network access. Its service is now disabled in the app manifest and fails closed
without creating a TUN. The capture UI directs users to the separately installed
PCAPdroid companion. Final validation must cover the merged manifests and verify
this unavailable state; live companion capture remains unproven.

## Beta cold-start observation (2026-10-07)

Two normal V1 launches on API35 x86_64 emulator-5580 were killed by Android
with “failed to complete startup” while full Gradle lint ran on the same host.
The audit instrumentation itself passes (1 test, 9.343 seconds). No cold-start
fix or causal attribution is established. Once Gradle stopped, a normal cold
launch succeeded in 7.406 seconds and the final Models screen showed the real
bundled starter loaded. This establishes a successful emulator launch, not
a physical startup latency target; physical startup remains untested. Evidence:
`../meshlit-validation/beta-startup-during-build.log`.
