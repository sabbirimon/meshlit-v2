# Meshlit session handoff — saved after beta publication

2026-10-07, Asia/Dhaka. Owner IMON stopped for sleep, requested saving all progress,
then explicitly requested APK upload. Saving/uploading is complete. Do not resume
other implementation, builds or publication until IMON requests it.

Project: `/Users/code/Documents/Codex/2026-10-06/re/outputs/meshlit`.
Branch: `codex/meshlit-ui-pipeline-openclaw`.
Remote: https://github.com/sabbirimon/meshlit-v2

## Published and verified

Release: https://github.com/sabbirimon/meshlit-v2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.1
Tag: **v2.0.0-beta.1**, source commit `ad2d3a86f5060ace52c1b46c7a5501253dcc01f7`.
Public prerelease, not draft; release ID **405174992**. All eight assets uploaded.
Every GitHub SHA-256 digest matches the locally verified file. Evidence:
`../meshlit-validation/github-beta-publication-results.json`.

Assets: Full ARM64/x86_64 APKs, restricted Play Review ARM64/x86_64 APKs and AAB,
BetaTesting.md, release-info.json and SHA256SUMS. They are debug-signed beta/review
artifacts, not Play-approved releases. Files: `../meshlit-beta/`.

Source, About/topics, Apache-2.0 LICENSE/NOTICE, colorful README and real screenshots
are published. Branding: “Many nodes. One mind.” Owner: IMON. Codex by OpenAI is
credited in README/AUTHORS and new commit trailers. Sidebar account association
is controlled by GitHub; no Codex avatar appearance was promised or verified.
GitHub Packages is separate from APK Releases.

## Final validation

Combined build: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6m32s, all Full flavors and Review APK/AAB.
639 unit tests pass: 8 audit, 65 cloud, 46 network, 260 inference, 130 app per Full
flavor. No failures/errors/skips. Full lint: zero fatal/errors, 348 warnings and
17 hints each. Review: zero fatal/errors, 351 warnings/17 hints.
Log: `../meshlit-validation/release-final-validation.log`.

One actual API35 x86_64 Android audit instrumentation test passed in 9.343 seconds:
device/human-task metadata, encrypted journal reopening, metadata export.
`../meshlit-validation/audit-android-final.log`.
Final Chat, Models and Monitor were inspected; the real starter was loaded and
runtime ready. Cold launch succeeded in 7.406s after Gradle stopped; two starts
during lint had ANRs. Physical Samsung was not attached. Loader visual proof is
pending. Review installed/launch command completed; its UI was not inspected.

Static Review checks: restricted manifest/policy copies and 23 ARM64 native SO
libraries with 16 KiB ELF alignment pass. Actual 16 KiB runtime/AAB tests and Play
approval remain open. CI passed at 2e37dcd (run 37536692867); later docs-only CI
was not awaited. Full runtime source is unchanged from db3aaed, Review overlay
fix is 53ac70c. Port-allocation tests were made bounded without changing TCP/TLS
production code or dropping auth/pin/real byte-forwarding assertions.

Earlier failed logs are retained: SDK package name, incremental Review resource
state, interrupted lint, optional-telephony overlay lint and test port conflicts.
Legacy traffic-dropping VPN is disabled in Full/removed in Review. PCAP imports
have real bounded parser tests; external PCAPdroid capture remains untested.

## Remaining work on explicit resume

1. Physical phone oversized-model layer execution and replicated coordinator/
   task/session memory/KV recovery proof; no claimed completion percentage.
2. Cold-start latency/ANRs, loader visual capture, physical UX; further SDK telemetry
   review/opt-out and hosted Grafana/collector/account integration proof.
3. Real SSH, OpenClaw, Android autonomy, VM/VNC, providers/media and training tests.
   Security/root/Magisk/forensic/radio/MCU/vendor adapters remain reviewed plans or
   partially implemented contracts, not turnkey tested capabilities.
4. Play production identity/signing, private privacy contact, AI reporting/content
   prevention, SDK Data safety and actual 16 KiB device/AAB/Console review.
5. Remaining legacy UX/tutorial/IDE polish and warning cleanup, tracked in the
   build/feature/evidence ledgers. Existing local artifacts and test logs must
   remain intact; do not replace real data with stubs.

No active local build or upload remains. Beta source tag stays fixed at the SHA
above; later publication-status documentation commits do not change its artifacts.
