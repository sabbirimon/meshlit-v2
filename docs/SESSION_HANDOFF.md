# Meshlit current session handoff
<!-- meshlit-document-tracking:start -->
Tracking reconciled 2026-10-10: [Plan](../PLAN.md) · [Progress](../PROGRESS.md) · [Document status](DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md).
Scope: cross-platform tracking; feature and device gates remain separate. Phase labels in older sections retain their original scope.

Updated 2026-10-10, Asia/Dhaka. Current work is authorized by the owner; the old stopped-session handoff is preserved in history/SESSION_HANDOFF-2026-10-07.md.

Repository: /Users/code/Documents/Codex/2026-10-06/re/outputs/meshlit. Review branch: codex/hyperl-production-library. Publication remote: sabbirimon/meshlit-v2. Draft review: https://github.com/sabbirimon/meshlit-v2/pull/2. Do not force-push, merge or submit to Play without the applicable owner instruction.

## Latest owner direction — plan first

The owner chose detailed stabilization planning before implementation and requested a build guide. Read [stabilization plan](desktop/STABILIZATION_PLAN.md) and [build guide](desktop/STABILIZATION_BUILD_GUIDE.md). S0–S6 are proposed gates; no milestone implementation or new release was performed for this refinement. Prior source/runtime evidence below remains dated. Resume implementation only when the owner requests it.

## Current checkpoint

Intel Studio build 40.1 application source is 12bd20a; evidence/source checkpoint 630cba2 is followed by the portable test fixture and documentation checkpoint c1f2d60, now the published release source. It adds a compact offline starter, verified baseline/AVX2 engine, lifecycle/resource controls, shared memory-aware layer planning and categorized/searchable management. The current owner asks to reconcile all Markdown plans/progress/phase tracking; this documentation update does not alter native/model bytes in the qualified installers.

Both Intel DMG/PKG are built and recovered launchers pass real local generation/authentication/unload and HyperL JNI using their bundled runtime. All payload files, execute bits and sealed hashes match the signed image. PKG monitor/render pass. DMG was extracted directly as HFS+ because OS mounting failed; no clean-machine installation is claimed. App ad-hoc signed, PKG unsigned, neither notarized. About 5 GiB of duplicate test/staging files was reclaimed; one working app, final installers and primary inputs remain.

521 current valid JVM executions and 9 crawler cases pass; both Full Android V1/V2 assemblies/lints pass with existing warnings. Four matched Intel timing cases show faster AVX2 here with substantial variation and no general speed multiplier. No fresh phone install or physical cluster proof is claimed.

## Resume priorities and status sources

Intel release is public with all eight asset digests matched: https://github.com/sabbirimon/meshlit-v2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-macos-intel-build40.1. Structured proof: desktop/evidence/github-studio-release-check.json. Release details: RELEASE_EVIDENCE.md. Exact failures and payload observations: DESKTOP_BUILD_LOG.md and desktop/evidence. Current workstreams and next gates: ../PLAN.md, ../BUILD_MILESTONES.md, ../TODO.md and DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md. Detailed desktop category state: DESKTOP_FEATURE_TRACKER.md / desktop-features.json; Android comparison: ANDROID_DESKTOP_PARITY.md.

Desktop live-worker RPC, agent/MCP/A2A authority bridge, durable audit, VM/container/Kubernetes, native OS firewall/capture, cloud vault/billing, complete repair and independent platform/device qualification remain open. NEXT has no DevEco/HAP/device proof; production is a separate admission decision.
