# Markdown documentation status and workstream tracking

Reconciled 2026-10-10. This index covers every tracked first-party, historical, protected and third-party Markdown file. The index itself is generated; counts below exclude this index to avoid self-hashing.

[Plan](../PLAN.md) · [Progress](../PROGRESS.md) · [Milestone gates](../BUILD_MILESTONES.md) · [Desktop feature tracker](DESKTOP_FEATURE_TRACKER.md) · [Release evidence](RELEASE_EVIDENCE.md)

## Workstream phases

Phase names are independent workstreams, not a unified numbered stage or an overall completion percentage. Source, contracts, host/device qualification, release and production admission are separate states. Historical phase numbers remain dated design labels.

| Workstream | Current qualification | Next gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local core engine | Host/payload verified; Experimental | Clean-machine, lifecycle/stress, wider quality and hardware |
| Shared sharding | Contract-tested planner; desktop executor pending | Live paired-worker controller and independent-device oversized-model/peer-loss proof |
| Desktop management | Partial source and scoped host qualification | Remaining real category controllers and operational acceptance |
| Android reliability | Current build/lint gate passes; older device proof dated | Current Samsung/Xiaomi/Windows category device qualification |
| Governed agents and fleet | Android reference; desktop authority/audit port pending | Common permission/controller/audit bridge before autonomous MCP/A2A/hooks |
| Platform and distribution | Intel recovered payloads pass; upload pending; no production promotion | Remote digests/publication, clean-target signing/privacy and independent OS/device gates |

## Coverage and maintenance

118 active, 19 historical, 8 protected, 1 template, 6 third-party; 153 Markdown documents including this index.

Active files receive current tracking links. Historical records retain exact dated claims; protected licences/attribution/versioned policies, third-party texts and PR templates are indexed without content edits. Runtime evidence is read from the named ledger, never inferred from a document date or checksum.

Run `python3 scripts/update-doc-tracking.py --write` after updating plans, then `--check`. The JSON manifest records normalized content hashes and classification; it is not a runtime certificate. Feature/module references are separately checked by scripts/validate-feature-map.py.
