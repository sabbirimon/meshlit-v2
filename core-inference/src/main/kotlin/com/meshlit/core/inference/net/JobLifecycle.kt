/**
 * Optional seam the embedded [InferenceHttpServer] consults once per
 * `POST /v1/infer` to record job-start and job-end events. The
 * default is a no-op so nodes that don't wire a listener still
 * serve inference.
 *
 * `:app` provides an implementation that bridges into the
 * `MetricsRegistry` so the `MetricsScreen` queue gauge and failure
 * breakdown reflect what the server is actually doing.
 *
 * The token returned from [start] is opaque to the server; the same
 * value must be handed back to [end] for the listener to pair them
 * correctly. The server is single-call-site so this is easy.
