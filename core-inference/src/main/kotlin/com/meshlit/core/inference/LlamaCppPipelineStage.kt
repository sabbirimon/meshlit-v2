/**
 * Phase 2 — wraps a [LlamaCppInferenceEngine] with a stage role
 * and a layer slice. The wrapper is the unit of work the
 * [PipelineCoordinator] drives per stage: it loads the shard,
 * stitches an inbound hidden state into the local KV cache, eval's
 * the local layers, and emits an outbound [ActivationPacket] with
 * the resulting hidden state.
 *
 * The wrapper is intentionally a thin façade over the engine —
 * the meaty logic lives in the JNI shim. The Kotlin side just
 * marshals between the wire-format packets and the engine's
 * `nativeLoadModelLayered` / `nativePipelineStep` /
 * `nativeGetLastHiddenState` surface.
 *
 * Constructor parameters:
 *  - `engine` — the underlying inference engine. In production
 *    this is the same `LlamaCppInferenceEngine` instance the
 *    coordinator uses for whole-model loads; tests can inject a
 *    stub.
 *  - `role` — where this stage sits in the pipeline. Drives which
 *    side of the channel the stage subscribes to.
 *  - `layerStart` / `layerEnd` — exclusive range passed to
 *    [LlamaCppInferenceEngine.loadModel].
 *  - `embeddingDim` — the model's hidden-state size. Captured at
 *    load time so we can size the inbound + outbound buffers
 *    without re-reading the model descriptor.
 *
 * The wrapper is [AutoCloseable] so the orchestrator can dispose
 * it deterministically when the pipeline finishes.
