/**
 * Wire-format DTOs for the embedded HTTP/SSE inference server.
 *
 * These types are the *public contract* between Meshlit devices on the
 * LAN. They live in `:core-inference` so both server-side (the
 * NanoHTTPD routes) and client-side (the Android `:app` client) share
 * them. The companion wire types for `RequestHints` (the
 * `X-Meshlit-Hints` header) live next to `RouterRef` because the
 * router only consumes them on the server side and they're not part
 * of the JSON body schema.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *  - snake_case is used for JSON fields to match HTTP/REST norms.
 *  - All numeric fields use conservative defaults that match the
 *    `InferenceEngine.InferenceRequest` defaults.
 *  - The `InferDoneEvent` mirrors the fields of an `InferenceResult`
 *    but only the bits the wire needs (no internal tags, no
 *    embeddings).
 *
 * Stability:
 *  - The wire is **v1**. Field additions are fine; renames or removals
 *    require a new route prefix (`/v2/infer`).
 *  - See BUILD_GUIDE §2 Phase 4.5 for the OpenAI-compatible gateway
 *    that will subsume these endpoints later.
 *
 * Phase M — monitoring:
 *  - `HealthResponse` gained four new fields (`capability_tier`,
 *    `engine_tag`, `loaded_shards`, `metrics`). All nullable so old
 *    clients still decode cleanly.
 *  - `MetricsSnapshot` is the in-process tail emitted with every
 *    `/v1/health` reply; the cluster pulls it to drive the
 *    `MetricsScreen` queue gauge + failure breakdown.
