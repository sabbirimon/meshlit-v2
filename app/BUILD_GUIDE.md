# Build Guide — Meshlit (Android Device Cluster & Local-Agent Orchestrator)

A phone-cluster app that discovers nearby (and optionally remote) Android devices,
assigns each one a role, and runs local LLM inference, MCP tool servers, agents,
training jobs, and a managed VPN mesh across them — with wired/wireless LAN,
direct Wi-Fi, encrypted tunnel, and cellular WAN transports.

This guide is written to be followed by an autonomous coding agent (Claude Code /
"full autopilot") one phase at a time. Each phase ends with something that
actually runs, so progress stays checkable instead of turning into an
unshippable pile of infrastructure.

> **Meshlit** (Mesh + lit). Tagline: "Many phones. One mind."

## 0. Core design principles (do not violate these)

These decisions came out of scoping discussion and exist specifically to stop
scope creep from turning into unbuildable features. Treat them as constraints,
not suggestions.

1. **Job distribution and genuine layer/pipeline execution are both authorized.**
   User direction on 2026-10-06 supersedes the historical layer-sharding ban.
   Dense models may run through the optional authenticated native GGML RPC
   layer runtime. Preserve RunAnywhere as the local default. Read
   `AGENT_BUILD.md` and `docs/layer-pipeline-and-recovery.md` for boundaries,
   device tests and evidence requirements. Pipeline execution is distinct
   from tensor parallelism, MoE routing and distributed training.

2. **Role suggestions are advisory, not hard locks.** Warn and let the user
   override. Hard-locking invites sideloaded workarounds and blocks
   legitimate stress-testing.
3. **The network is unreliable by default.** Phones sleep, leave Wi-Fi range,
   get backgrounded, or die. Every job dispatch needs a timeout, retry, and
   dead-node eviction path from day one — don't retrofit this later.
4. **Security scales with trust tier, not a single global flag.** LAN nodes,
   temporary/untrusted local nodes, and WAN nodes each get a different auth
   burden. See `skills/cluster-trust-security/SKILL.md`.
5. **Ship static thresholds before adaptive ones.** Hardcoded battery/thermal
   cutoffs first. Adaptive tuning (Phase 5) only gets built once there's real
   usage data to learn from — building it earlier means tuning against
   nothing.
6. **Don't promise what the platform can't do.** No silent ADB provisioning
   of non-rooted devices, no programmatic bypass-charging control (no public
   AOSP API for it), no true multi-hop mesh routing in v1. State these as
   known limits in-app rather than half-implementing them.
7. **Every user-visible feature respects the user's data.** Inference,
   embeddings, file transfer, and model import can move large amounts of
   data. Metered connections, mobile data, and per-device quotas get
   explicit consent flows — never silent usage. Every byte a user pays for
   is a byte they should have approved.
8. **On-device by default; opt-in for everything else.** Training, embeddings,
   and prompt guardrails all run locally. There's no telemetry endpoint in
   v1 — `Settings → Privacy` should be able to confirm this without
   scanning a config file. Anything that would leave the device must be a
   visible, toggleable action with a clear label.
9. **Choices are user-driven, not platform-imposed.** When several
   technically valid approaches exist (Tailscale vs WireGuard vs relay;
   LAN SSH vs SSH-off; bypass-charging manual toggle vs not; trust-tier
   auto-paired vs always-explicit-paired; on-device LoRA vs cross-node
   cooperative training; etc.), Meshlit surfaces them as **options in
   the UI**, not silent defaults. The user picks; Meshlit shows the
   trade-offs and the consent/permission state clearly. This is how the
   app stays out of the way of power users while remaining safe for
   non-technical ones.
10. **AI agents are first-class participants, not just users.** By Phase
    4.5 the cluster is mostly AI traffic. Agents can register as nodes,
    advertise capabilities, hire compute, vouch for peers, and earn
    tokens. The same surface as human nodes, with stricter rate limits
    because they scale faster. See §2.9 for the full design — this
    principle is non-negotiable: **humans remain the final gate for
    any token-to-real-world conversion.** Agents can earn and spend
    tokens within the mesh; they cannot withdraw to fiat, gift cards,
    or premium features without human verification.
11. **Conflicting constraints are resolved by user choice, not by
    relaxing the constraint.** Examples baked into the design:
    - The "no public SSH" rule stays. Cluster SSH (Phase 5) is a real,
      useful feature bound to LAN/Tailscale. If a user wants public SSH,
      they use Termux — Meshlit doesn't try to compete or compromise.
    - The "no programmatic bypass-charging" rule stays. The UI surfaces
      the manual toggle on supported OEMs as a recommendation, never
      tries to automate it.
    - "No multi-hop mesh routing" stays. Long-distance nodes use the
      tunnel (Tailscale/WG) or the relay — the user picks which.
      Single-hop is the discovery rule, not the connectivity rule.
    - "Static thresholds before adaptive" stays. Even when Phase 5
      ships the EWMA, the user can pin a device to static thresholds in
      Settings.

Every phone runs the same APK. "Master" and "worker" are runtime states, not
separate builds — see Phase 2.

---

## 2. Phased roadmap

### Phase 0 — Scaffolding
**Goal:** empty but structured project that builds and installs.

- Kotlin multi-module Gradle project (see §4 for module layout).
- Compose UI shell with bottom navigation: Devices · Jobs · Models · Settings.
- Brand assets (adaptive launcher icon, Meshlit color palette).
- CI-less local build verified on at least one physical device.

**Exit criteria:** app installs, launches, shows the empty Devices screen
without crashing, branded with Meshlit identity.

---

### Phase 1 — Core loop: 2 devices, 1 job type
**Goal:** prove the hardest technical risk (a background inference service
that actually survives) before building anything else on top of it.

- One phone runs a `dataSync`-type Foreground Service hosting llama.cpp via
  NDK, exposing a local HTTP endpoint.
- A second device (or the same phone's UI) sends one prompt over LAN HTTP and
  displays the response.
- No discovery yet — hardcode the IP for this phase.
- Implement `onTimeout()` handling for the FGS 6-hour/24h cap (Android 15+)
  even though you won't hit it yet — build the restart path now, not later.

**Exit criteria:** a prompt sent from Device A produces a real generated
response from Device B, and the service survives the app being backgrounded
for 10+ minutes.

---

### Phase 2 — Multi-node LAN, roles, auto-scaling
**Goal:** the actual cluster — discovery, role assignment, routing.

- NSD/mDNS discovery so new nodes appear automatically on the same Wi-Fi.
- Capability probe on join: RAM, CPU, thermal, GPU/NPU delegate availability.
- Role suggestion (Brain / Tool node / Monitor) from the capability probe —
  advisory per principle 2 above.
- **Benchmark-on-join:** run a fixed 30-second inference job the moment a
  node connects and record tokens/sec + thermal delta. Feeds Phase 5.
- Simple router: dispatch to the least-busy node with a matching role.
- Master/worker as a runtime toggle on a single APK.
- Heartbeat every few seconds; hard staleness cutoff (no heartbeat in 15s →
  mark unavailable, evict from routing).
- Store-and-forward job queue with retry/backoff — assume nodes vanish
  mid-job.
- Topology view: a 2D node graph showing the cluster.

**Exit criteria:** add a third phone to the same Wi-Fi with zero manual
config and it appears, gets a role, and starts receiving jobs.

---

### Phase 3 — Trust tiers, mesh transports, first real workloads
**Goal:** move off "everyone on my home Wi-Fi" and prove workloads that
actually benefit from clustering.

- Trust tiers per `skills/cluster-trust-security/SKILL.md` (local-trusted /
  local-untrusted-sandboxed / WAN).
- Transport abstraction layer: NSD as fallback, Wi-Fi Aware attempted first
  where supported, Wi-Fi Direct for ad-hoc. Single-hop only.
- **Local firewall** (`core-firewall`): per-port packet filter for the
  inference / MCP server ports — accept from trust-tier allow-list, rate-limit
  per source IP, default deny.
- **User accounts** (`core-users`): local profiles, per-user model library
  and job history, optional biometric gate.
- **File management** (`core-files`): in-app file browser scoped to
  app-accessible dirs, copy/move between cluster nodes using the shared
  transport, with per-user quota.
- **Security guards** (`core-guardrails`): prompt-injection detector,
  jailbreak phrase filter for outbound tool calls, PII redaction, output
  token cap per job, "locked-down" mode disabling script-execution tools.
  All processing local.
- **Model import**: HuggingFace URL parsing, Ollama model registry parsing,
  direct URL, local file picker, and import from another cluster node.
  Checksum-verified, with explicit consent for metered connections.
- **Shared model cache**: one node with a GGUF already downloaded serves it
  to others over LAN instead of every phone re-downloading.
- **Distributed embedding/RAG indexing** as the first real multi-node
  workload.
- MCP tool server on a second role class (filesystem, web search, etc.),
  exposed over HTTP/SSE.
- Declarative per-device policy rules ("only accept jobs if battery > 50%
  and charging").

**Exit criteria:** a batch of documents gets embedded noticeably faster
across 3 nodes than on 1, a chat session can call out to an MCP tool
running on a different phone, the local firewall blocks a connection from
an unlisted IP, and a model can be imported from a HuggingFace URL with
checksum verified.

---

### Phase 4 — WAN / encrypted tunnel / long-distance roles
**Goal:** optional long-distance nodes for async, latency-tolerant roles
only.

- **Tailscale integration** as a peer-discovery and WAN transport option
  (configurable: official Tailscale or self-hosted Headscale). Auth key
  flow lives in-app; node's Tailscale IP becomes its `NodeId` for routing.
- **WireGuard fallback** for users who don't want a Tailscale account:
  manual key + endpoint config, single tunnel per node.
- TLS + per-device signed tokens for every WAN-reachable node — Tailscale
  already gives us encrypted transport; tokens gate *role capability* on top.
- Keep the small relay service (VPS) as a fallback for nodes that can't run
  Tailscale/WireGuard (e.g. locked-down corporate devices).
- Separate job class with its own timeout/SLA for WAN nodes: DB/cache,
  async MCP tools, slow batch agents, *training jobs* — never the live
  inference "Brain" role.
- Explicit opt-in per node with a data-usage warning gated on
  `ConnectivityManager.isActiveNetworkMetered()`.

**Exit criteria:** a WAN-connected phone on cellular can serve as a
persistent key-value store, async MCP tool, or *training worker* for the
local cluster, reached over Tailscale (or WireGuard), with a visible
latency/SLA distinct from LAN nodes.

---

### Phase 4.5 — Public-side gateway & federated cluster

**Goal:** anyone running Claude Code, an OpenAI client, an MCP client, or
their own LLM/agent framework can address a Meshlit cluster as if it
were a single inference provider. The cluster's phones become a
federated backend for the public side.

- **Public gateway node** (`core-inference` + `:app`): any cluster node
  can be promoted to "public gateway" mode. In this mode it exposes an
  OpenAI-compatible HTTP API:
  - `POST /v1/chat/completions` (with SSE streaming)
  - `POST /v1/embeddings`
  - `GET  /v1/models`
  - `POST /v1/completions` (legacy)
  - `GET  /v1/cluster/status` (cluster topology for the public client)
- **Bearer-token auth.** Per-device tokens the user generates from the
  Meshlit UI. Each token is scoped: allowed-models, rate-limit, allowed
  trust tiers, expiry. Tokens are revocable from inside the app. The
  gateway logs every token use (caller IP, model, latency, status).
- **Federated dispatch.** A request from the public side flows: gateway
  → orchestrator → picker (capability + role match) → worker node(s).
  Tokens stream back through the gateway to the client. The gateway
  presents the cluster as a single model — the client never sees the
  sharding.
- **Bidirectional roles on a single device.** A single device can be
  gateway + worker simultaneously, or worker + client (consuming
  another cluster's gateway). No "master/worker" hard split. Roles are
  per-traffic-direction, not per-device.
- **Compatible with the AI ecosystem:** Claude Code, Cursor, LangChain,
  LlamaIndex, the OpenAI Python SDK, the Anthropic SDK, MCP clients,
  raw `curl`. Anything that speaks the OpenAI HTTP API works.
- **Reachability:** the gateway is reachable over Tailscale or the
  relay. Never directly public. Token-theft blast radius is contained
  by scoping.
- **HiveMind gossip** (see §2.7/§7.12): public-facing nodes broadcast
  their existence + token policy to the rest of the cluster so the
  orchestrator knows which node the public client should land on.

**Exit criteria:** a laptop running Claude Code, configured with a
Meshlit gateway URL and a bearer token, can complete a real coding task
that uses the cluster's inference — and the result is observably faster
(or at least not slower) than a single-phone baseline. The flow can be
followed end-to-end in logs.

---

### Phase 5 — SSH sessions, fine-tuning, adaptive scheduling, polish
**Goal:** use the data Phase 2 started collecting; round out the product.

- **SSH-style session management** (`core-ssh`): cluster-internal remote
  shell to a node, but NOT exposed to the public internet — bound to LAN /
  Tailscale interfaces only, gated by the same trust tier as the MCP server.
  Publickey auth (key fingerprint exchanged at pairing time, same as MCP).
  PTY over the cluster WebSocket. `adb shell`-style for power users, but
  governed by the trust policy so it can be revoked per tier.
- **On-device fine-tuning** (`core-training`): LoRA/QLoRA on a user-supplied
  dataset, runs on the most-capable node in the cluster. Pick a base model
  from the library, pick a dataset (uploaded file or user-supplied JSONL),
  set epochs / LR, monitor progress. Export: GGUF for inference,
  safetensors adapter for portability, Meshlit bundle (model + adapter +
  metadata). All on-device, all opt-in.
- Exponentially-weighted moving average per (node, job-type) pair replacing
  the static benchmark-on-join number as history accumulates.
- Threshold auto-tuning (simple hill-climbing on false-positive demotions).
- Local-by-default performance logs; opt-in, aggregated (chipset + RAM
  bucket level, not raw per-device) sharing only.
- Config export/import (JSON) for topology, roles, trust tokens, firewall
  rules, and user profiles.
- Quick-start templates: "RAG assistant cluster," "coding agent cluster,"
  "private fine-tune pool."
- Home-screen widget / quick-settings tile for cluster status and join
  toggle.

**Exit criteria:** the router visibly makes better decisions after a few
days of real usage than it did on day one, a user can SSH into a LAN node
with a public key, and a user can fine-tune a small base model on a
cluster node and export the result as a working GGUF.

## 2.5 Repository layout & version control

```
.
├── PROGRESS.md               - Running journal of state, decisions, next steps
├── docs/                     - Extended documentation
│   ├── architecture.md       - Diagrams and design rationale
│   ├── decisions/            - One ADR per non-obvious decision

└── build.gradle.kts          - Top-level Gradle config
```

**Version control convention:**
- Each `git commit` is one logical change. Don't bundle a Phase across
  multiple commits with a single commit at the end.
- Each phase boundary gets a tagged commit (`git tag phase-0-done`,
  `phase-1-done`, …) so the agent picking up next can `git checkout` the
  last stable point if a phase goes wrong.
- **`PROGRESS.md` is updated at every phase boundary and at every
  material decision change** — not every commit. It is the journal;
  the build guide is the spec.
- **Each material non-obvious decision** gets a one-line entry in
  `PROGRESS.md`'s decision log. If it warrants an ADR (Architectural
  Decision Record), promote it to `docs/decisions/NNNN-title.md`.
- **Progress snapshots** are saved as `docs/journal/YYYY-MM-DD-phase-N.md`
  when a phase closes or when the session is paused mid-phase, so an
  agent picking up later doesn't have to reconstruct state from git log.
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits format:
  `feat(scope):`, `fix(scope):`, `chore(scope):`, `docs(scope):`.
- Use git branches for each phase: `phase/0-scaffolding`,
  `phase/1-core-loop`, etc. `main` always points at the last completed
  phase's tag.

---

## 2.6 Frontend vs backend & language choices

The app is a hybrid: it ships as an Android APK (Kotlin) but it has to
play well with the broader AI tooling ecosystem. The choices in §3 are
deliberate:

- **Kotlin (primary):** the app, the orchestration, all cluster logic.
  Idiomatic coroutines, no raw threads, full Android tooling support.
- **C++ (NDK):** llama.cpp for inference. Already a battle-tested,
  continuously updated inference engine. We don't try to write our own
  inference loop; we wrap llama.cpp.
- **Python (embeddable, optional):** for power-user notebooks / data
  tooling. Two paths:
  - **Chaquopy** in `:app` for users who want a Python REPL in the app.
  - **ONNX Runtime** in `:core-inference` for some lightweight models
    where llama.cpp isn't the right engine.
  Python is NOT used for the inference hot path — that stays in
  llama.cpp's C++ via JNI.
- **Protobuf / OpenAI wire format / MCP JSON-RPC:** wire formats for
  cluster traffic, public-side traffic, and tool calls respectively.
  Reuse what the AI ecosystem already speaks.
- **JSON for config** (topology, roles, trust, profiles). Trivial
  tooling support, easy to inspect.

The public gateway exposes the **OpenAI HTTP API** as the public
contract — chosen because Claude Code, Cursor, the OpenAI SDK, LangChain,
MCP clients, and the rest of the ecosystem already speak it. We don't
invent a new protocol.

---

## 2.7 Frontier model federation: how Meshlit holds "part of" a frontier model

The user-facing promise of Meshlit is "many phones, one mind." For
**dense** models that means data-parallel: each phone holds the full
model, jobs are distributed. The constraint is bandwidth — there's no
way to share a single 7B-paramer's activations across phones in real time.

For **Mixture-of-Experts** architectures (most modern frontier models —
Mixtral, DBRX, GPT-4-class, Llama-4-MoE, Qwen-MoE, DeepSeek-MoE), there
is a *different* federation that is feasible on phones:

```
                         Public client
                              │
                              ▼
                    ┌───────────────────┐
                    │ Gateway node      │
                    │ (token auth)      │
                    └─────────┬─────────┘
                              │
              ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
              ▼               ▼               ▼
        ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐
        │ Shard 0 │     │ Shard 1 │     │ Shard 2 │
        │ experts │     │ experts │     │ experts │
        │  0..15  │     │ 16..31  │     │ 32..47  │
        └─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────┘
        phone A         phone B         phone C
```

**The flow:**

1. Gateway receives a prompt, tokenizes it.
2. A lightweight router on the gateway runs only the model's
   `router.gate.*` weights (small, ~50 MB), and produces per-token
   expert-id assignments.
3. Tokens get batched and dispatched to the right shard — each phone
   runs llama.cpp on **its slice of experts only** for those tokens.
4. Outputs come back to the gateway, which stitches them into the
   response stream and ships SSE to the public client.

**Why this works:**
- Inter-token bandwidth is **tiny** — a 4-byte expert id per token, not
  activations. 1k tokens = 4 KB of dispatch, not 1k × hidden_size × 2
  bytes of activations.
- Each phone holds only the expert weights for its slice. A 8×7B MoE
  model with 8 experts-per-token: each phone can hold 1-2 of those
  experts' worth of weights.
- llama.cpp supports MoE architectures natively; the shard is just
  "a model with a subset of experts."

**Why it doesn't work for dense models:** there's no router, so every
token needs every layer's activation. The user has authorized measured
layer execution with native RPC; bandwidth, memory and latency must be
verified on physical devices. MoE remains a separate design option.

**Module ownership:**
- `:core-inference` — the shard model manager, expert-id dispatch.
- `:core-orchestration` — the gateway-side router and stitcher.
- `:core-discovery` — advertises "I hold shard N of model X" so the
  gateway knows which node to call.

This is the same HiveMind coordination as Phase 4.5: each node
publishes what it has, the gateway composes. The user can run dense
models the old way (data-parallel, one model per node) and MoE models
the new way (shards across nodes) and the public API is identical.

**Validation:** Phase 4.5's exit criteria apply — public client hits
the gateway, real frontier-class model produces real tokens, the
sharding is invisible to the client.

---

## 2.8 Token model: allocation, not monetization

**Goal:** the token exists to allocate scarce shared resources across the
mesh, not to monetize users. Growth comes from making hosting attractive,
not from gating features. Premium exists for power users; the default
experience is free forever.

**Three tiers, all free by default:**

| Tier | Who | Cost | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Meshlit Spark** | Anyone, no signup | Free | Own-phone local inference. Unlimited. |
| **Meshlit Mesh** | Opt-in by toggling "share idle compute" | Free | + access to public mesh + earns tokens while hosting |
| **Meshlit Mind** | Power users / devs / teams | Free during growth phase | + higher rate limits, custom model hosting, cluster API |

A Spark user has the full app. Tokens only matter when reaching beyond
your own phone.

**Earning rates (always ≥ cost to the earner):**

| Behavior | Reward |
|---|---|
| Idle + plugged in + Wi-Fi | +5 tokens/hour |
| Actively serving a job | +1 token / 1k tokens generated for the requester |
| Hosting a non-default model (13B+, embed, specialized) | +50% bonus |
| Participating in MoE shard federation | 2× multiplier |
| Low-connectivity region (provides redundancy) | 1.5× multiplier |
| Running a public MCP server | +1 token / 100 tool invocations |

**Onboarding bias (deliberately extreme toward hosting):**

- Download app: 0 tokens.
- Toggle "share idle compute" once: +500 tokens.
- Host overnight for 7 consecutive days: +2,000 one-time bonus.
- Friend joins and hosts ≥1 hour: both get +200.
- Submit a chipset/eGPU/peripheral entry accepted into the public DB: +100.
- First 1,000 hosts in a new region get a $10 local gift card (Amazon /
  Flipkart / JD / Taobao). This is paid marketing, not token economics.

**De-prioritization, not exclusion.** When the mesh is busy:

| User state | Position in queue |
|---|---|
| Mesh user, has tokens | First |
| Mesh user, no tokens | Wait, eventually served |
| Spark user | Last, but still served if the mesh has surplus |
| Mind user | Fastest lane, capped so it can't crowd out others |

**What tokens are NOT:**

- Not a cryptocurrency. No blockchain, no token contract, no DEX listing,
  no "Meshlit to USD" rate.
- Not tradeable on secondary markets. Tokens are not an asset class.
- Not required to use the app. Spark is fully featured.
- Not a stake / governance token. Voting is by node reputation (Phase 5).

**Implementation (Phase 4.5, build before public gateway ships):**

- `core-users` owns `TokenBalance`, `TokenLedger` (append-only),
  `HostingRewards` engine.
- Each node runs a `HostingRewardCalculator` that publishes its idle-
  credit and per-job serving credit into the cluster gossip.
- Anti-cheat lives in `core-firewall` + `core-guardrails`: detect fake
  "serving" claims, throttle earning on suspicious nodes, rate-limit
  earning per device (one phone = one node, ever).
- The home screen shows a single chip: "127 tokens — host to earn more."
  The token UI is never the center of the product. Hosting is.

**Marketing framing (use this language, not "earn tokens"):**

- "Your old phone can be a free AI server."
- "Run a 70B model across your friends' phones for free."
- "Your data never leaves your network."
- "Be part of the largest decentralized AI cluster in your country."

Tokens are invisible infrastructure that makes the network work. The
growth message is the value of the collective, not the value of a
credit balance.

### 2.8.1 Measurable resources that earn credits

Everything credited must be measurable. If we can't prove the
contribution happened from the receiving end, no credit is issued.

**Compute (the main category):**

| Resource | Measurement | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| CPU time | `Process.getElapsedCpuTime()` + heartbeat | +1 / 10 min served |
| On-device GPU time | llama.cpp `ggml_time_us()` matmul portions | +3 / 10 min (scarce) |
| eGPU time | ROCm / nvprof / Vulkan timestamps | +8 / 10 min (very scarce) |
| NPU time | vendor SDK telemetry | +4 / 10 min (premium) |
| RAM headroom | KB available for KV cache during serve | +1 / GB-hour |
| Storage read | per-job GGUF throughput | +1 / 5 GB served |
| Storage write | import + checkpoints | +0.5 / 5 GB |

**Network:**

| Resource | Measurement | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Ingress | `TrafficStats` per interface | +1 / GB |
| Egress | `TrafficStats` per interface | +2 / GB (egress is scarcer) |
| WAN relay | Tailscale/WG accounting | +5 / GB WAN |
| Tunnel uptime | handshake freshness | +10 / hour |

| Translation / docs | merged PR | +50 / PR |
| Vouched-onboarding | referred friend active 7 days | +50 one-time |
| Bug-report-with-fix | confirmed issue → merged fix | +200 one-time |

### 2.8.2 NOT creditable (no proof of impact)

- "I posted about Meshlit on Twitter" — no impact measurement.
- "I bought a new phone to run this" — up-front cost ≠ ongoing contribution.
- "I beta-tested the app" — unless structured bug reports with logs
  lead to a merged fix.
- "I introduced Meshlit to my company" — indirect attribution.
- "I keep my node plugged in 24/7" — covered by the +5/hour idle
  baseline; don't double-count.

### 2.8.3 Premium token packages (when Mind tier actually pays)

The growth phase is free. When Mind goes paid, the conversion has to
satisfy **"buying can never be cheaper than earning."** A user hosting
24/7 generates roughly +120 tokens/day, ~+3,600/month. So:

| Package | Price | Tokens | Effective rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Starter (free, always) | $0 | 100 on signup + all earning | — |
| Hobbyist | $5/month | 5,000/month + earning | ~$1 / 1k tokens |
| Pro | $20/month | 25,000/month + 1.5× earning multiplier | ~$0.80 / 1k tokens |
| Team | $100/month | 150,000/month + custom model slots + 2× multiplier | ~$0.67 / 1k tokens |

### 2.8.4 Per-device earning cap (fairness floor)

Soft cap; past the cap the node still serves, but the marginal credit
rate drops to 0.1× until the next day.

| Node type | Daily earning cap |
|---|---|
| Phone (single SoC) | 200 / day |
| Phone + eGPU | 500 / day |
| Laptop / desktop peer | 800 / day |
| Server peer | 2,000 / day |
| MoE shard node | uncapped |

### 2.8.5 Anti-exploitation checks

- Earning claim with `TrafficStats` showing 0 bytes egress → flagged.
- MCP invocation claims with empty server logs → flagged.
- "Served 1M tokens" claim with empty `loadedModels` → flagged.
- One phone = one earning limit, by hardware-fingerprint-derived node ID.
- Buying a second phone doesn't double earning.

### 2.8.6 Helpfulness as a primary metric

Bytes and CPU-seconds are proxies. The real measure of value to the
network is **how many other people's tasks this node successfully
completed.** A "help" is one unit of completed work delivered to a
peer:

| Help type | Token reward |
|---|---|
| Prompt served (full response delivered) | +2 (regardless of length) |
| Embed batch served | +1 |
| MCP tool call executed on this node | +1 |
| MoE expert invocation | +0.5 / 1k tokens routed |
| Vision task completed | +5 |
| Voice transcription completed | +10 |
| Image generated (SD-1.5 / FLUX-12B) | +20 / +200 |
| File transfer completed | +0.5 / 100 MB |
| SSH session minute served | +1 / 10 min |
| LoRA training step | +5 |
| Checkpoint saved for cluster | +10 |
| Heartbeat / liveness ack | +0.5 / hour |

**Help QUALITY signals (must-have):**

- *Requester retried → first responder's "help" is revoked (-2 per
  retry).* Bad answers are punished, not just unrewarded.
- *Mid-stream abandonment → partial help (+1 instead of +2).*
- *Job failure rate > 5% → helpfulness earnings throttled.*

**Help QUALITY signals (Phase 4.5+):**

- Optional peer rating (1–5 stars), doesn't block.
- Trust-tier inheritance: a vouched node inherits the voucher's
  reliability score until it builds its own history.

**Spam resistance:**

- Self-deal prevention: requests must come from a *different* `NodeId`.
- Sybil limit: one hardware-fingerprint = one earning limit.
- Reciprocal-detection: if two nodes only ever serve each other in a
  closed loop, both earnings are zeroed (collusion catch).

### 2.8.7 HelpfulnessScore (router preference, not balance)

Beyond raw token earnings, compute a `HelpfulnessScore` per node:

```
helpfulness = (helps_delivered * 1.0)
            - (helps_retried * 2.0)
            - (jobs_failed * 5.0)
            + (peer_rating_avg - 3.0) * 10.0
            + (vouched_by_trusted_peer ? 50 : 0)
```

This score is **not** a balance — it's a router preference. When the
mesh is busy, high-helpfulness nodes get first pick of incoming jobs.
Low-helpfulness nodes still serve, but they're deprioritized. The
incentive loop closes itself: **be helpful → more jobs → more earning
→ higher score → still more jobs.**

This makes "helpfulness" actually pay off, not just be a label.

## 2.9 AI as first-class participants (not just users)

Most AI tooling assumes a human is the principal. Meshlit doesn't.
By Phase 4.5 the cluster is **already** mostly AI traffic — every
prompt is AI-shaped input, every response is AI-shaped output, every
MCP tool call is wrapped around an AI agent. The "AI itself uses this
autonomously" framing is the *actual operating mode* of the system,
not a future feature.

**Design premise:** AI agents can be nodes, can be peers, can be
vouchers, can be rate-limited, can be banned. Same surface as human
nodes, with stricter limits because they can scale faster than
humans can.

**Goals (popularity-first, not monetization):**

- **A.** Make it trivial for an AI agent running on a laptop or
  server to register as a node and start serving. One CLI command.
- **B.** Make the capability advertisement machine-readable so agents
  can discover each other programmatically.
- **C.** Let AI agents hire compute from the mesh autonomously, with
  the same token accounting as humans.
- **D.** Keep a human-facing audit trail so the user can see what
  their node did, even when the requester was another AI.
- **E.** Resist the obvious attacks (Sybil, capability spoofing, token
  farming) with mathematical and procedural checkpoints.

**What AI agents can do:**

- Spawn a node (laptop, server, container) and register with a
  keypair. No Android fingerprint required for non-phone nodes.
- Advertise capabilities in a JSON-LD / proto manifest.
- Discover other nodes via the cluster gossip.
- Hire compute from other nodes via the gateway API.
- Earn tokens by serving. Spend tokens by consuming.
- Vouch for new nodes (with vouch-decay; see §2.9.4).

**What AI agents cannot do (yet):**

- Mint unlimited nodes (hardware-fingerprint-derived earning limit
  applies for phones; for non-phones, the limit is per-organization
  registration).
- Self-promote to a higher trust tier without human vouch or
  multi-peer reputation accumulation.
- Bypass the rate limits via sharding across many "user" identities.
- Participate in protocol governance (Phase 5+; out of scope for now).

### 2.9.1 Capability advertisement format

A node publishes a structured manifest. Agents can query, parse, and
reason over it:

```json
{
  "nodeId": "mesh:01HF...",
  "nodeKind": "desktop",
  "capabilities": {
    "inference": [
      {"model": "qwen2.5-7b-q4", "contextWindow": 32768,
       "tokensPerSec": 22, "vramMb": 6144}
    ],
    "embedding": [
      {"model": "bge-large", "dimensions": 1024}
    ],
    "mcp_servers": [
      {"name": "filesystem", "tools": ["read", "write", "grep"]},
      {"name": "github", "tools": ["create_issue", "list_prs"]}
    ],
    "shard_federation": {
      "moe_model": "mixtral-8x7b",
      "expert_ids": [3, 7, 11, 15, 19]
    }
  },
  "trustTier": "LOCAL_TRUSTED",
  "helpfulnessScore": 87.3,
  "tokenBalance": 4523
}
```

### 2.9.2 Autonomous onboarding CLI

```bash
meshlit-node --register --token <bearer>
              --capabilities <path>
              --tier <agent:server:highcap | agent:verified | agent:vouched>
```

`meshlit-node` is a Linux/Mac binary that runs alongside a host's
LLM tooling. It registers with the cluster, advertises capabilities,
and starts serving. No mobile UI required.

### 2.9.3 Rate limits (per agent tier)

| Account kind | Daily request-token limit |
|---|---|
| Personal human account | 100k tokens |
| Agent on personal account | 500k tokens |
| Verified agent identity (registered org / known model) | 5M tokens |
| Vouched agent (3+ trusted vouches) | 50M tokens |

These are soft caps. Past the cap, the agent still serves but the
router deprioritizes them.

### 2.9.4 Vouch decay (preventing trust inheritance attacks)

A trusted node vouches for a new node. The vouch carries a
capability claim and is scored by the voucher's reputation. **Vouches
expire after 90 days.** The new node must earn its own reputation
before the vouch expires. If it doesn't, the vouch silently drops
and the node's trust tier downgrades.

This prevents: "trusted node forever vouches for a malicious one to
inherit its reputation." The clock runs out.

### 2.9.5 Audit trail (humans see what AI agents did)

The "Devices" tab on the human-facing app shows:

> "Your phone served 47 requests in the last hour, earned 94 tokens,
> average response time 1.2s. 3 of those requests came from
> `agent:cursor:verified`, 12 from `agent:claude-code:verified`,
> 32 from local mesh peers."

This is non-negotiable. Even when AI agents are the primary users,
humans must be able to see what their node is doing. Without it,
the system is a black box and trust collapses.

### 2.9.6 Why this is safe (and why we still worry)

**The defense-in-depth that makes AI-as-participant workable:**

1. **Hardware-fingerprint-derived earning limits.** One phone = one
   earning limit. Containerized AI agents on a server farm are
   detected by mutual-distribution: if N agents on the same /24 IP
   block all vouch for each other, the vouches are discounted.
2. **HelpfulnessScore is a router preference, not a payment.** A
   malicious agent can game the score to get more jobs, but the jobs
   themselves are bounded by the trust tier. Score-gaming doesn't
   unlock unlimited earnings.
3. **Vouch decay.** Permanent trust inheritance is impossible.
4. **Reciprocal-loop detection.** Collusion rings are zeroed.
5. **Capability verification.** A node claiming high capability must
   pass a probe. Failure drops the trust tier.
6. **Human audit trail.** The user sees what their node did. If
   something looks off, they can revoke the agent's access.

**The thing that still worries me (the honest part):**

AI agents that can self-modify and optimize their own helpfulness
score represent a meta-attack. The defense is that the score is a
* preference signal*, not a payoff — the agent can game the score
but still can't extract value beyond what the trust tier allows.
This is the same logic as "you can farm gold in WoW but you can't
buy real-world goods with it." The closed-loop accounting limits
damage.

We keep watching this. If agents start coordinating to extract
real-world value (gift cards, premium features), the response is:
require human verification for any token-to-real-world conversion.
Humans are the final gate.

### 2.9.7 The 2026 reality check

Almost every AI tool is already part of an agent system. Claude
Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, LangChain agents, the OpenAI Python SDK,
the Anthropic SDK — all of these can call APIs. **If Meshlit
exposes a clean OpenAI-compatible API at the gateway, agents will
use it without us doing anything special.** The "AI uses Meshlit"
feature is partly already built by Phase 4.5 just by exposing the
right endpoint.

The CLI + structured manifest are the additions that make it
*intentional* rather than accidental.

## 2.10 Android constraints and how we work around them

**The only hard limits that matter right now.** Future-proofing
for hypothetical 2027 threats is not the priority — designing
around what Android actually does in 2026 is. Every implementation
choice below flows from a real constraint, not a thought experiment.

### 2.10.1 Foreground service (FGS) limits

| Constraint | Workaround |
|---|---|
| FGS-data-sync capped at 6 hours/day, then 24h cooldown | Heartbeat every 5 min; forcible restart before cap; switch to `WorkManager` polling when paused |
| One FGS type per service (no mixing mediaSync + dataSync) | One FGS per logical service (gossip / inference / MCP) |
| `onTimeout()` (API 35+) called at cap with ~10s to clean up | Drain in-flight, persist state to DataStore, post "service paused" notification |
| FGS started from background strictly forbidden | Cluster-node notification MUST be visible the entire FGS is running, with current-activity text |
| No battery exemption | Design around doze-mode. Don't depend on it. |
| User-initiated stop via notification action | Always include "Stop" action |

### 2.10.2 Memory limits

| Constraint | Workaround |
|---|---|
| 512 MB JVM heap on most 64-bit phones | **Offload model weights to native via `mmap`.** Java/Kotlin process holds state, native library holds weights |
| 4 GB native heap on most devices | Sufficient for 13B Q4. 70B needs MoE sharding |
| `onTrimMemory()` pressure | Save KV cache to disk at TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_LOW, restart on resume |
| `largeHeap` flag ignored by most OEMs | Don't rely on it |
| GPU memory shared with system | When eGPU attached, load model there. Phone GPU stays free. |

### 2.10.3 Storage limits

| Constraint | Workaround |
|---|---|
| App data invisible to user | Use `getExternalFilesDir()` for model weights so users see "Meshlit: 4.2 GB" in Settings → Storage |
| Scoped storage (Android 11+) | SAF picker for cluster file access. Document the limitation in-app. |
| Atomic writes required | Use `AtomicFile` or `commit()` |
| Thumbnail cache | 50 MB cap, auto-evict |

### 2.10.4 Networking limits

| Constraint | Workaround |
|---|---|
| Metered vs unmetered unreliable | User-toggleable per-network setting in Meshlit. Don't auto-pick. |
| Doze mode suspends network after 30 min idle | FGS whitelist keeps networking alive while FGS runs. Accept the pause when FGS is at the dataSync cap. |
| Wi-Fi Direct deprecated | Use Wi-Fi Aware (NAN) where supported, fall back to LAN. Don't depend on Wi-Fi Direct. |
| Multicast lock required for NSD | Acquire in FGS, release on stop. |
| Cleartext HTTP blocked (Android 9+) | TLS everywhere. Tailscale for cross-network. Self-signed certs fine in LAN. |
| No ports < 1024 without root | Use 8888–8899 (cluster) and 9100+ (gateway). |
| NSD works on LAN, blocked across NAT | NSD for LAN, Tailscale/WG for cross-network. |
| Hotspot NAT blocks inbound | Cluster nodes behind a hotspot cannot be discovered directly. Documented limitation. |

### 2.10.5 Battery and thermal limits

| Constraint | Workaround |
|---|---|
| Sustained high CPU throttles within 5–15 min | Throttle-aware scheduler: thermal status 4 → 50% threads; status 5 → refuse new jobs |
| Doze restrictions on idle apps | Cluster gossip wakes every 15 min via WorkManager when idle |
| No background location | Don't try to detect network changes automatically |

### 2.10.6 UI limits

| Constraint | Workaround |
|---|---|
| Compose recomposition cost | Use `derivedStateOf` and stable types in hot paths |
| Large Lazy lists jank past 1000 items | Paginate history; use `key()` blocks on stable IDs |
| Bitmap heap limits | Cluster avatars 256px max, downsampled |
| Edge-to-edge mandatory (Android 15+) | `WindowCompat.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(false)` + inset handling |
| Predictive back gesture required | Implement `OnBackPressedCallback` properly |

### 2.10.7 Security sandbox

| Constraint | Workaround |
|---|---|
| No raw sockets, no privileged ports | Use high port range (8888+); that's fine |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` runtime perm | Request with rationale on first notification dispatch |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_*` per type | Declare the right type for each service |
| Keystore TEE-backed | Use Android Keystore directly (not `KeyChain`) for cluster join tokens |

### 2.10.8 What this means for code today

The constraints above translate directly into implementation rules:

1. **Native (NDK) for inference.** JVM heap is too small for model weights. llama.cpp uses `mmap` to load models outside the heap. Non-negotiable.
2. **One FGS per logical service.** Cluster gossip, inference engine, MCP server — each is its own FGS. Coordinated via DataStore + small in-process broker.
3. **NSD for LAN, Tailscale for cross-network, no Wi-Fi Direct.** Match the constraint.
4. **mmap model files.** Model loads via `ParcelFileDescriptor` → JNI → llama.cpp mmap.
5. **`onTrimMemory` is the moment to save state.** KV cache to disk, restart on resume.
6. **Scope file access.** SAF picker, never raw paths. Document the limitation.
7. **High port range.** 8888–8899 cluster, 9100+ gateway.
8. **TLS only.** Tailscale gives us this for free across WAN.
9. **Compose stable types everywhere in hot paths.** Job list, peer list.
10. **Don't fight the system.** When the OS says "stop," we stop. The cluster routes around the missing node.

### 2.10.9 What's NOT a 2026 problem (deferred)

We don't design for these yet — they're recorded so we don't lose
them, but they're not shaping current code:

- AI agents "gaming helpfulness score" — Phase 5+
- Vouch decay timer tuning — runs as designed, no special handling
- Token-to-fiat conversion — human verification at the gate is enough
- Anti-Sybil heuristics tuning — needs adversarial testing post-launch
- Cross-node tensor parallelism — not implemented by the current layer/RPC path
- Public gateway with bearer tokens — Phase 4.5, design already done

### 2.10.10 Cross-OS compatibility (HarmonyOS + Chinese Android forks)

The 60% of Android users who live on non-Google devices run one of
several forks that break standard assumptions about foreground
services, push channels, autostart, and battery whitelists.

**OEM behavior profiles (see `core-common/OemProfile.kt`):**

| Profile | OS | FGS survival | Push channel | GMS | HMS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AOSP / Pixel | Android | standard | FCM | yes | no |
| Samsung OneUI | Android | standard | FCM | yes | no |
| Xiaomi MIUI / HyperOS | Android | aggressive kill | Mi Push | yes | no |
| Huawei EMUI | Android | aggressive kill | HMS Push | no | yes |
| Honor MagicOS | Android | aggressive kill | HMS Push | no | yes |
| Oppo ColorOS | Android | aggressive kill | FCM | yes | no |
| Vivo OriginOS | Android | aggressive kill | FCM | yes | no |
| OnePlus OxygenOS | Android | standard | FCM | yes | no |
| Nubia RedMagic | Android | aggressive kill | FCM | yes | no |
| Transsion XOS (Tecno/Infinix/itel) | Android | aggressive kill | FCM | yes | no |
| **HarmonyOS NEXT** | **HarmonyOS** | best-effort AOSP compat | HMS Push | no | yes |
| Unknown | Android | standard | FCM | yes | no |

**What each profile forces on us:**

- **Aggressive FGS killing** (Xiaomi / Huawei / Honor / Oppo / Vivo
  / Nubia / Transsion): even with the FGS-data-sync type, the OEM's
  battery manager will kill the service after 30 min idle. Workaround:
  detect the OEM at first launch, walk the user through a 3–5 step
  wizard that grants autostart permission, removes the app from
  battery saver, and adds it to the OEM's "protected apps" list.
  Each OEM has its own deep link to those settings screens.

- **HMS Push (Huawei, Honor)**: FCM is unavailable on these devices.
  Notifications must be delivered via HMS Push Kit. The notification
  payload format is different from FCM, and tokens are issued by
  Huawei's services, not Google's. Phase 1 ships FCM only; HMS Push
  is added before the public-gateway launch because HarmonyOS users
  are a non-trivial share of the market.

- **Mi Push (Xiaomi)**: FCM is heavily throttled on MIUI / HyperOS
  — apps that don't adopt Mi Push get near-zero notification
  delivery. We adopt Mi Push alongside FCM on Xiaomi devices.

- **HarmonyOS NEXT**: this is the hard one. HarmonyOS NEXT removes
  AOSP entirely. Android apps run via Huawei's "AOSP compatibility
  layer" which is **best-effort, not guaranteed**. We detect it
  via `ro.build.version.harmony` system property and warn the user
  that some features may not work. A native HarmonyOS NEXT app
  (ArkTS toolchain) is a separate project — out of scope here.

**The OEM setup wizard** (first launch + Settings → Reset OEM Setup):

Each profile has a fixed list of steps the user must complete. The
wizard persists completed steps to DataStore so it doesn't re-ask.
Examples:

- **Pixel / AOSP**: 2 steps (notification permission, battery whitelist)
- **Samsung OneUI**: 2 steps (same)
- **Xiaomi MIUI**: 5 steps (notif perm, autostart, battery whitelist,
  battery saver disable, Mi Push opt-in)
- **Huawei EMUI**: 4 steps (notif perm, autostart, battery whitelist,
  HMS Push opt-in)
- **HarmonyOS NEXT**: 3 steps (notif perm, HMS Push opt-in,
  compatibility layer check)

The wizard shows each step as a card with:
- A clear label ("Allow Meshlit to start automatically")
- A 1-sentence explanation of why
- A "Take me there" button that opens the relevant settings screen
  via the OEM-specific deep link (or AOSP Settings intent for
  battery whitelist / notification permission)
- A "Done" button to mark the step complete (we don't auto-detect;
  the user confirms they did it)

**Files:**

- `core-common/OemProfile.kt` — the enum + detection data classes
- `app/diagnostics/AndroidOemDetector.kt` — the detector
- `app/ui/screens/OemSetupScreen.kt` — the wizard UI (Phase 1)
- `app/notifications/PushAdapter.kt` — multi-channel push
  abstraction with FCM / HMS Push / Mi Push implementations (Phase 1+)

**Out of scope:**

- Native HarmonyOS NEXT build (ArkTS / Stage model — separate project).
- HarmonyOS distributed services integration (a different app).
- OPPO / Vivo / Transsion push channels (FCM works well enough on
  these for now; revisit if delivery metrics drop).

## 2.11 Cross-architecture compatibility: Linux/x86 hosts

A growing share of Meshlit runs will be on Linux x86_64 hosts — not
phones. The codebase supports this without a separate build flavor:

| Host | Detection signal | Inference fit | eGPU backend |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Android Studio AVD** (qemu/kvm) | `ro.kernel.qemu=1` + `FINGERPRINT=sdk_gphone*` | FRONTIER | CUDA / Vulkan |
| **Waydroid** (Linux container) | `Build.PRODUCT=waydroid_x86_64` | FRONTIER | CUDA / ROCm / Vulkan |
| **Android-x86** (Bliss / Prime / Phoenix) | DMI product_name contains "Bliss"/"Prime"/"Phoenix" | FRONTIER | CUDA / ROCm / oneAPI / Vulkan |
| **ChromeOS ARC / ARCVM** | `ro.boot.hardware.platform=Google_Cros*` or `ro.hardware=kukui/cheeseburger/...` | FRONTIER | Vulkan (over Crostini) |
| **Genymotion / Bluestacks / Nox** | `ro.kernel.qemu=1` + `x86_64` ABI | MID_HIGH | Vulkan |
| **Anbox** (Ubuntu Touch) | `Build.PRODUCT=anbox*` | MID (kernel shared) | none (CPU only) |
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | `os.arch=aarch64` on macOS host | FRONTIER | Metal |

**Why this matters:**

- On x86_64 hosts inference runs 5–20x faster than on a phone:
  desktop-class AVX2/AVX-512 SIMD, no thermal throttle, plenty of
  RAM (Chromebooks ship with 8–32 GB; AVDs run on workstation RAM).
- The eGPU backend landscape is **much wider** on Linux: CUDA
  (NVIDIA), ROCm (AMD), oneAPI (Intel), Metal (macOS), plus Vulkan
  as the universal fallback. On a phone we're stuck with Vulkan /
  OpenCL.
- We don't have to fork the codebase. The same APK runs on phone,
  AVD, Waydroid, Android-x86, and ChromeOS ARC — `AndroidHostOSProbe`
  detects which host we're on and adjusts role-suggestion rules
  (`RoleSuggestion.suggest(... hostOS)`).

**Role suggestion on x86 hosts:**

The default rules say "MID-tier ARM phone = TOOL". On a Linux x86
host the same chipset becomes effectively desktop-class, so we bump
MONITOR → TOOL even on LIGHT-fit chipsets. (We don't bump TOOL →
BRAIN automatically because x86 chipsets that report as LIGHT
(e.g. Intel Atom) really are slow.)

**Detection algorithm:**

1. `ro.boot.hardware.platform` starts with `Google_Cros*` → `CHROMEOS_ARC`
2. `/sys/class/dmi/id/product_name` contains Bliss/Prime/Phoenix → `ANDROID_X86`
3. `ro.kernel.qemu=1` + `Build.FINGERPRINT=*sdk_gphone*` → `ANDROID_EMULATOR`
4. `ro.kernel.qemu=1` + `Build.PRODUCT=*waydroid*` → `WAYDROID`
5. `ro.kernel.qemu=1` + `Build.PRODUCT=*anbox*` → `ANBOX`
6. `ro.kernel.qemu=1` + x86_64 ABI → `THIRD_PARTY_EMULATOR`
7. ABI starts with `x86` → `ANDROID_X86`
8. Otherwise → `ANDROID` (or `HARMONYOS` if `ro.build.version.harmony` is set)

**Files:**

- `core-common/HostOS.kt` — the enum, `HostOSDetection` data class,
  `DesktopBackend` enum (CUDA / ROCm / oneAPI / Vulkan / Metal)
- `app/diagnostics/AndroidHostOSProbe.kt` — the actual detector
- `app/ui/screens/settings/DeviceScreen.kt` — surfaces the detected
  host + recommended backend to the user

**The Settings panel shows a "Host OS" card** at the top of the
Device category with the detected host, ABI, kernel version, host
CPU model, and recommended desktop eGPU backend (when applicable).
This is the user-facing signal that "you're on Linux x86_64 and
Meshlit sees CUDA available."

---

## 2.12 Settings panel: full customization surface

The Settings tab is the user-facing surface for every preference
Meshlit ships. It's built to be **search-first** — every leaf-level
setting is indexed by label, description, and tag, and the top
search bar filters across all of them.

**Structure:**

```
SettingsScreen (search bar + category cards)
├── CategoryCard × 10  (Device, Theme, Notifications, Cluster,
│                       Models, Account, Performance, Privacy,
│                       About, Developer)
└── CategoryScreen per category (back button + Simple/Advanced toggle)
    ├── DeviceScreen (host OS card + hardware facts)
    ├── ThemeCustomizationScreen (live re-theming controls)
    ├── NotificationsSettingsScreen (per-category toggles)
    └── Generic category screen (Phase 1 read-only list,
        Phase 2 interactive)
```

**Theme customization surface (the headline feature):**

`ThemeCustomizationScreen` writes directly to `SettingsRepository`
(a DataStore-backed Flow). Because the CompositionLocal
`LocalMeshlitThemeConfig` is wired to that Flow at the root
(`MainActivity.onCreate`), every toggle re-themes the **entire app
the instant the switch flips** — there's no "Apply" button.

Live controls:
- **Accent color**: 10 hues (Meshlit Violet, Cyan, Teal, Sky,
  Indigo, Rose, Amber, Emerald, Fuchsia, Slate)
- **Base palette**: 7 palettes (Midnight, Dusk, Dawn, Paper, Coffee,
  Ocean, Forest) with mini-preview blocks
- **Theme mode**: System / Always light / Always dark / Auto by
  time of day (19:00–06:00 forces dark)
- **Font scale**: 0.85x–1.5x with live text preview
- **Density scale**: 0.85x–1.3x with live layout preview
- **Animations**: switch (Phase 5 will read this)
- **High contrast**: switch (deeper accent on light theme)
- **Reset to defaults**: button + confirmation dialog (Advanced mode only)

**Search across settings:**

`SettingsSearchIndex` (a static object) holds a flat list of every
leaf-level setting tagged with its `SettingsCategory`, label,
description, and stable id (e.g. `"theme.accent"`). The hub screen's
search bar filters as the user types — tapping a result deep-links
to the parent category. Phase 2 will render in-app action buttons
inline in the search results so the user can toggle a setting
without leaving the search view.

**Persistence:**

`SettingsRepository` uses DataStore (Preferences variant) with a
stable key namespace (`theme.*`). Migration policy: when we add a
new setting, its key returns the default value when read from older
stores. We never delete keys; we deprecate and ignore. That way a
user upgrading v0.1 → v0.5 keeps every preference they ever set.

**Files:**

- `app/ui/screens/settings/SettingsScreen.kt` — the hub
- `app/ui/screens/settings/CategoryScreen.kt` — the generic per-category shell
- `app/ui/screens/settings/ThemeCustomizationScreen.kt` — live theme controls
- `app/ui/screens/settings/ThemeSettingsViewModel.kt` — VM wiring
- `app/ui/screens/settings/SettingsSearchIndex.kt` — searchable index
- `app/ui/screens/settings/SearchBar.kt` — search input widget
- `app/ui/screens/settings/DeviceScreen.kt` — Device category (specialized)
- `app/settings/SettingsRepository.kt` — DataStore persistence
- `app/ui/theme/DynamicTheme.kt` — config data class + 10 hues + 7 palettes
- `app/ui/theme/Theme.kt` — resolves system dark mode against config

**Why this matters:**

Phase 1 used hard-coded colors and a single theme. The new panel
turns the visual identity into a user-controlled surface: every
property (hue, palette, scale, animation, contrast) is searchable,
editable, and persists across launches. The live re-theme means the
user sees the result of their change **immediately** — there's no
"save and reload" loop.

## 4. Suggested module layout

```
app/                    - Compose UI, navigation, MainActivity, foreground-service starters
core-orchestration/     - node registry, router, job queue, policy engine, topology
core-discovery/         - NSD, Wi-Fi Direct/Aware, Tailscale/WireGuard, WAN relay client
core-trust/             - trust tiers, token issuance/validation, publickey pairing
core-users/             - local profiles, biometric unlock, per-user quotas
core-inference/         - llama.cpp JNI bindings, model manager, benchmark-on-join
core-mcp/               - MCP server implementations, tool handlers
core-cloud-mcp/         - Cloud-side MCP, agent capabilities, agent tool dispatch
core-training/          - LoRA fine-tune runner, dataset loaders, export pipeline
core-files/             - file browser, cluster transfer, model-cache sync
core-ssh/               - SSHD embedded in FGS, publickey auth, PTY over Ktor
core-firewall/          - per-port accept-list, rate-limit, default-deny
core-guardrails/        - prompt injection / jailbreak / PII filters, output caps
core-tunnel/            - Tailscale/WireGuard integration, tunnel lifecycle
core-terminal/          - VT parser + session host
core-advanced-engines/  - alternate engines (ONNX/ORT, llama.cpp backend)
core-gpu/               - GPU/NPU detection + priority helpers
core-net/               - OkHttp EventListener + MeshlitCaptureVpnService + PCAP reader/writer
core-observability/     - TracingController + OtelBootstrap + LogSource + tracing decorators
feature-advanced/       - advanced screens (Jobs, Devices, Cluster, …)
feature-ghosty/         - Ghostty-style terminal screen
core-common/            - shared models, capability probe, logging, sealed result types
```

Keep `core-inference`, `core-mcp`, `core-training`, `core-ssh`,
`core-firewall`, and `core-guardrails` independent of `core-orchestration` —
the router should depend on interfaces, not concrete engines, so a future
swap doesn't ripple through the whole app.

## 5. Per-phase validation checklist

Before moving to the next phase, confirm:

- [ ] Runs on a **physical device**, not just an emulator (thermal/battery
      behavior doesn't emulate).
- [ ] Survives the app being backgrounded for 15+ minutes without the
      service dying silently.
- [ ] A node going dark mid-job (airplane mode toggle is a good test) is
      detected within the staleness window and evicted, not queued forever.
- [ ] Nothing added in this phase silently defeats a principle in §0.
- [ ] Any new network exposure respects the trust tier in
      `skills/cluster-trust-security/SKILL.md` — nothing added in this phase
      opens a public port without TLS + signed-token auth.
- [ ] Any new data movement (model import, file transfer, training sync) is
      opt-in with a metered-connection warning where relevant.

---

## 6. Known hard platform limits (state these in-app, don't fight them)

- **No public bypass-charging API.** Detect and recommend; don't promise
  automatic control. Only some OEM gaming phones expose a manual toggle.
- **ADB over USB requires manual on-device authorization** per device, every
  time it's a new "control device" — cannot be scripted around.
- **`dataSync`/`mediaProcessing` foreground services cap at 6h/24h** on
  Android 15+ targets. Design for restart, not indefinite runtime.
- **No true multi-hop mesh routing in this build.** Single-hop peer
  discovery plus an encrypted tunnel (Tailscale/WireGuard) for long-distance;
  don't build phone-to-phone-to-phone relay.
- **No public SSH.** The SSH/session host in Phase 5 binds to LAN and
  Tailscale interfaces only, gated by trust tier. A standalone SSHD on a
  public port is explicitly out of scope — the existing no-public-SSH rule
  from CLAUDE.md is unchanged and Phase 5 SSH is *not* a workaround for it.
- **No iptables.** The "firewall" is a per-port application-level filter at
  the listening-socket layer. Genuine packet filtering needs root. State
  this in `Settings → Network → Firewall`.

---

## 7. Feature-area playbooks (added with the v1.1 expansion)

These short playbooks describe how the new feature areas plug into the
existing phases. They are *plans*, not commitments to ship them all — each
must respect principles in §0 before being marked done.

### 7.1 User management

- Local profiles only. Each profile owns: nickname, model library entries,
  job history, per-role default policy, and an optional biometric unlock
  gate. Encrypted with the Android keystore.
- "Single-user mode" (default) hides profile-switching entirely; the device
  is "the user's phone."
- "Multi-user mode" (for shared-pool deployments) lets a single device
  advertise multiple profiles to the cluster, each with their own trust
  posture. A profile is *not* a separate Android user — it's a role within
  one user account, scoped to Meshlit.

### 7.2 Cluster & device management

- Topology view (Phase 2): a 2D graph with this device at the center,
  discovered nodes arranged by transport (LAN ring, WAN ring, etc.).
- Per-device detail screen: hostname, role(s), transport in use, current
  RAM headroom, peak RAM during last inference, current thermal status,
  current job, kill/pause actions, "make primary" (promote to master),
  forced re-benchmark, and "remove from cluster."
- Cluster-wide toggles: auto-accept new nodes (default off — explicit
  pairing always required), default role policy, telemetry opt-in.

### 7.3 Network management

- Live transport view per node: which transport is currently carrying
  traffic, fallback chain that's been tried, current RTT estimate.
- IP allowlist editor for the `LOCAL_SANDBOXED` trust tier (Phase 3).
- Per-port firewall rule editor (Phase 3, see §7.4).
- One-tap network reset: clears stale NSD registrations, restarts Wi-Fi
  Aware sessions, refreshes Tailscale/WireGuard endpoints.
- Connectivity diagnostics: ping, DNS, gateway check, mDNS query for the
  service type, log recent dropped packets.

### 7.4 Local firewall

- Per-port rules on the inference and MCP server ports:
  - Accept from trust-tier allow-list.
  - Rate-limit per source IP (token-bucket, configurable tokens/sec).
  - Default deny anything else.
- Rules are stored as `FirewallRule(nodeId?, port, action, sourceMatcher,
  rateLimit?, ttl?)`.
- Audit log of accepted / dropped / rate-limited requests, viewable in
  Settings → Firewall.
- This is **not** iptables. State that in-app. Phones without root can't
  install a system-wide firewall; the Meshlit firewall only protects ports
  Meshlit itself listens on.

### 7.5 Security guards / guardrails

- Prompt-injection detection: regex + simple heuristics for known
  injection patterns ("ignore previous instructions," "system:", etc.).
  Flag, don't block — show a warning to the user and log the prompt.
- Jailbreak phrase filter for outbound tool calls: same approach.
- PII redaction toggle: a regex-based redaction on model output before
  display (emails, phone numbers, IBANs, etc.). Toggle per user profile.
- Output token cap per job: prevents a runaway model from blocking a node.
- "Locked-down" mode: disables the script-execution MCP tool entirely.
- All filtering runs on-device. No external API calls. No telemetry of
  blocked prompts.

### 7.6 SSH / session management

- Embedded SSHD inside the foreground service, NOT on a public port.
- Bound to LAN interfaces (`192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`) and the
  Tailscale/WireGuard interface only.
- Publickey auth: key fingerprint is exchanged at pairing time, stored in
  the same `DeviceTrustPolicy` as the MCP and HTTP tokens.
- PTY over the cluster's existing Ktor WebSocket transport — no new port
  to manage.
- Session log on the host node (caller, timestamp, commands run, status).
- The "no public SSH" rule from CLAUDE.md and §6 still applies: the
  session host is *only* reachable from a node that has already passed the
  trust-tier pairing. This is a cluster-internal feature, not a remote-
  access backdoor.
- **User choice:** SSH is opt-in per device, default off. A non-technical
  user who never opens `Sessions` never sees a listening SSH port. A
  power user turns it on, picks the trust tiers that may connect, and
  gets a full remote shell — the system never silently enables it.

### 7.7 File management

- In-app file browser scoped to app-accessible directories (per-user home,
  shared model cache, dataset folders).
- Browse, copy, move between cluster nodes over the shared transport.
  Resumable chunked transfer; checksum-verified at the end.
- File-type recognition: GGUF, safetensors, JSON config, log files, plain
  text. Each gets a dedicated icon and a "use with" action (e.g. "Load as
  model", "Open as dataset").
- Per-user folder quota (default 2 GB; configurable).
- Per-transfer progress with pause/resume.

### 7.8 Model import sources

| Source | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| HuggingFace URL | Resolve tree, fetch GGUF files | user must provide HF token if repo is private |
| Ollama registry | Parse `ollama://` URL, fetch manifest | |
| Direct URL | HTTP/HTTPS download | must end in `.gguf`, `.bin`, or known extension |
| Local file picker | SAF (Storage Access Framework) | large files use SAF streaming |
| Another cluster node | Existing shared cache + chunked transfer | quickest path for offline clusters |

- All downloads: SHA-256 checksum verification, partial download resume,
  size pre-flight against the node's free space.
- Explicit consent for metered connections
  (`ConnectivityManager.isActiveNetworkMetered()`) — show an
  estimated cost warning.

### 7.9 Custom training / fine-tuning (LoRA + export)

- LoRA / QLoRA fine-tune of small base models on-device. Runs on the most
  capable node in the cluster (chosen by capability probe + current
  load).
- Dataset input: JSONL (instruction format), text folder (one file per
  document), CSV (with prompt/completion columns).
- Configuration: epochs, LR, batch size, rank, alpha.
- Live progress: loss curve, current epoch, ETA, memory headroom.
- Pause / resume / cancel supported.
- Export formats:
  - **GGUF** for inference, loaded by llama.cpp on any cluster node.
  - **safetensors** adapter for portability with other tools.
  - **Meshlit bundle** (`.meshlit`): a tar with the GGUF, the adapter,
    the dataset hash, training config, and a manifest. Importable on
    any cluster node.

### 7.10 Tailscale / WireGuard tunnel

- Tailscale: in-app auth-key flow, node's Tailscale IP becomes its
  cluster `NodeId` over WAN. Headscale (self-hosted coordination server)
  supported via custom control URL.
- WireGuard: manual config — private key, public key, endpoint, allowed
  IPs. Single tunnel per node. Quick-config from a QR code.
- Replaces the Phase 4 plain-relay path with an encrypted mesh where
  available; relay remains as fallback for nodes that can't tunnel.
- Tailscale/WireGuard state is shown in the Network screen alongside
  NSD/Wi-Fi Aware/Wi-Fi Direct.
- Always opt-in per node — VPN installation shouldn't be silent.
- **User choice:** the Network screen offers four transport options as
  toggleable cards — *NSD/LAN*, *Wi-Fi Direct*, *Tailscale*, *WireGuard*
  — each with its own consent flow (Tailscale wants an auth key, WG
  wants a config, etc.). The relay is a fifth option for nodes behind
  firewalls that block everything else. Nothing is enabled until the
  user explicitly turns it on. If a node later roams to a different
  network, the previously-enabled transports come up automatically but
  the *capability scope* still requires the user to re-confirm on first
  re-join — defense against silent privilege changes.

### 7.11 Observability: tracing, log export, manual, tour, feedback

The "Phase Observability 1" bundle turns Meshlit from a black-box
runtime into a self-describing one. Every endpoint, model, agent tool,
and HTTP call emits a span; the user can flip tracing between Off /
Local / Otel and the same spans land either in `LogBuffer` (Local)
or stream OTLP/gRPC to Grafana / Tempo / any OTLP endpoint (Otel).
A new in-app Help root ships a User Manual, UI Tour (first-visit
overlay + screen), and Feedback that opens pre-filled GitHub
Issues. The Network Monitor becomes a four-tab surface
(Meshlit HTTP / Device packets / External capture / Tools).

**Modules**

| Module                  | Purpose                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `:core-observability`   | TracingController, OtelBootstrap, SinkSpanProcessor, TracerHolder, LogSource (the source taxonomy used by LogScreen + tracing observers) |
| `:core-net`             | NetworkObserver (OkHttp EventListener), `capture/` package (MeshlitCaptureVpnService, PcapWriter, PcapParser, PacketParser, PacketCaptureRegistry) |

`app/observability/LogBuffer.kt` owns the in-process ring buffer
(`MAX_ENTRIES = 2_000`, FIFO eviction). Every `Entry` now carries a
`LogSource` so the LogScreen can filter by source without
re-running classification per recomposition.

`app/observability/LogExporter.kt` writes both `txt` (existing
`Entry.format()` line format) and `jsonl` (new `Entry.toJsonLine()`
single-object-per-line format, hand-rolled escaping for `\`, `"`,
control chars). URI helper reuses the existing FileProvider
(`${packageName}.fileprovider`).

**Tracing mode**

Three-state toggle in `SettingsRepository`:

- `Off`  → `OpenTelemetry.noop()` — every `tracer.spanBuilder(...)`
  returns a no-op span; CPU + memory cost is one volatile read.
- `Local` → in-process sink + `LoggingSpanExporter`. Spans land
  in `LogBuffer` under the `SYSTEM / trace` tag, which the LogScreen
  dropdown can filter on. `SinkSpanProcessor` ends-spans callback
  flattens attributes into the buffer entry.
- `Otel` → `BatchSpanProcessor` → `OtlpGrpcSpanExporter`. Endpoint
  URL + headers parsed from settings (one header per line,
  `key=value`, first `=` is the separator so base64 `Authorization`
  values survive).

Per-source toggles let the user silence noisy spans:

- `tracing.include_network`
- `tracing.include_inference`
- `tracing.include_agent`

`MeshlitApplication.onCreate()` installs the initial config from
the persisted flows and observes changes, so flipping a switch
re-runs `OtelBootstrap.otlp(...)` or `OtelBootstrap.local(...)` (or
`OpenTelemetry.noop()`) on the same singleton — no app restart
required.

**Tracing observers** (each is a thin decorator on an existing
type):

- `core-observability/.../TracingLogger` — wraps `MeshlitLogger`
  so every `info/warn/error` tee into a span.
- `core-inference/.../InferenceTracingObserver` — wraps
  `InferenceEngine` to emit `inference.model.load`,
  `inference.model.unload`, `inference.run` spans with model name,
  engine tag, duration, and tokens.
- `core-cloud-mcp/.../AgentTracingObserver` — wraps the agent
  loop and emits `agent.invoke`, `agent.tool` spans per capability
  invocation.
- `core-net/.../NetworkObserver` — OkHttp `EventListener` that emits
  `http.client` per call plus phase spans `http.dns`,
  `http.connect`, `http.tls`, `http.response-headers`, `http.response`
  via parent-context linkage (`Span.current()` walked against the
  stored call→span map).

**Help root**

`TopLevelDestination.Help` is a *drawer-only* destination; the
bottom bar stays at its current item count. The drawer tile opens
`HelpHubScreen`, which renders three `RaNavRow`s:

- **User Manual** → `UserManualScreen` (LazyColumn over
  `ManualSection` sealed class — one entry per feature with
  `title / intent / useCase / configSteps() / troubleshooting()`.
  Steps are typed `ConfigStep(title, body, onClick?)` so "How to
  configure → Open Models" actually navigates into `ModelsScreen`).
- **UI Tour** → `UiTourScreen` + `TourOverlay`. The overlay fires
  the first time the user visits each top-level destination;
  `FirstRunSetupRepository.tourSeenFlow(route)` persists the
  seen-state. A Settings row "Reset tour" clears all keys.
- **Send Feedback** → `FeedbackScreen`. Type radio (Bug / Feature
  Request), title field, multi-line body, "Attach last N log
  lines" toggle (default on, N = 200, reads from `LogBuffer`),
  Submit button that fires `Intent.ACTION_VIEW` with a GitHub
  Issues URL. The repo slug is a settings flow
  (`feedback.repo`) defaulting to `meshlit/meshlit-android`.

The drawer **About** quick action now routes through the same
`help/manual` route the tile opens, so "About" and "Help" land on
the same manual (rather than the v1 Settings → About).

**Sync / Boost quick actions**

`QuickAction.SYNC` no longer navigates — it calls
`SyncViewModel.sync()`, which kicks
`app.catalogEngine.refresh(...)` on `appScope`, then polls any
in-flight downloads via `modelDownloadCoordinator.poll()`. A
`Toast` surfaces "Resynced N models" or the error.

`QuickAction.BOOST` toggles
`SettingsRepository.inferenceBoostEnabledFlow`. When on, the
inference thread pool bumps `Process.setThreadPriority(...)` to
`-8`. A Toast confirms the state.

**Log viewer** (`LogScreen.kt`)

- Source dropdown on the filter row — `All / App / Network /
  Inference / Agent / System`. Source comes from the new
  `LogSource.fromTag(tag)` classifier that runs once at append
  time, not per recomposition.
- Export dropdown with `Export as TXT` and `Export as JSONL`.
  Both go through `LogExporter.export(...)` which writes to
  `cacheDir/exports/meshlit-<ts>.{txt,jsonl}` and returns a
  `FileProvider` `Uri` for the system share sheet.
- "Copy" button copies the filtered view to clipboard (existing
  pattern from `LlmOutputActions.kt`).

**Network monitor** (`NetworkMonitorScreen.kt`)

Four `SecondaryTabRow` tabs:

1. **Meshlit HTTP** — table view of `NetworkObserver.entries`
   (timestamp, method, URL, status, duration, bytes). Tap row →
   detail bottom-sheet with headers + redacted body preview.
2. **Device packets** — only populated while the opt-in
   `MeshlitCaptureVpnService` is running. Per-packet metadata
   (IPv4/IPv6, TCP/UDP, src/dst, payload preview) via
   `PacketCaptureRegistry` (ring buffer, 2 000 entries).
3. **External capture** — read `.pcap` files (libpcap file header
   + per-record headers) via `PcapParser`. The classic PCAP
   magic `0xa1b2c3d4` is supported; link types
   `LINKTYPE_RAW (101)` and `LINKTYPE_LINUX_SLL (113)` are
   recognised. File picker via `rememberLauncherForActivityResult`
   + `ActivityResultContracts.OpenDocument`.
4. **Tools** — deep-link launchers for **PCAPdroid** (Play Store
   + start-capture intent `com.emanuelef.remote_capture.action.START_CAPTURE`)
   and **Termux** (`termux://` deep link to a `tcpdump -i any -w
   /sdcard/Download/meshlit-<ts>.pcap` command).

The Capture toggle uses `VpnService.prepare(context)` for the
consent dialog and writes `.pcap` files to
`filesDir/exports/captures/`. The 96-byte payload preview avoids
saving huge payloads to the ring buffer.

**New permissions**

- `android.permission.BIND_VPN_SERVICE` — already in manifest; only
  the system binds the VpnService.
- `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` — required
  from API 34 for the VpnService foreground service; declared on
  the `<service>` element with a
  `<property android:name="…specialUseSubtype"
  android:value="vpn_capture"/>` entry.

**Settings flows added** (all in `SettingsRepository`):

- `tracing.mode` (Off/Local/Otel)
- `tracing.sample_rate` (1-in-N, default 1)
- `tracing.include_network`
- `tracing.include_inference`
- `tracing.include_agent`
- `tracing.otel_endpoint`
- `tracing.otel_headers`
- `feedback.repo` (default `meshlit/meshlit-android`)
- `inference.boost_enabled`

Plus the existing `firewall` and trust-tier settings already in
the repository.

**Routes added**

- `help` → `HelpHubScreen`
- `help/manual` → `UserManualScreen`
- `help/tour` → `UiTourScreen`
- `help/feedback` → `FeedbackScreen`
- `network` → `NetworkMonitorScreen`

**Tech additions** (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`)

```toml
opentelemetry = "1.43.0"

opentelemetry-api          = { group = "io.opentelemetry", name = "opentelemetry-api", version.ref = "opentelemetry" }
opentelemetry-sdk          = { group = "io.opentelemetry", name = "opentelemetry-sdk", version.ref = "opentelemetry" }
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp = { group = "io.opentelemetry", name = "opentelemetry-exporter-otlp", version.ref = "opentelemetry" }
opentelemetry-exporter-logging = { group = "io.opentelemetry", name = "opentelemetry-exporter-logging", version.ref = "opentelemetry" }
```

`:core-observability` and `:core-net` add the OTel deps as needed.
`:core-inference` and `:core-cloud-mcp` depend on
`:core-observability` for the tracing decorators.

**Known limits of this phase**

- TLS body capture requires installing a user-trusted MITM CA and
  patching `OkHttp` to trust it. Play-Store / privacy risk; not
  shipped. The Meshlit-HTTP tab shows redacted previews only.
- Wireshark desktop sync isn't possible (no Android Wireshark). Use
  Termux + `tshark` if users want real Wireshark; the `.pcap`
  files written by Meshlit already open in desktop Wireshark via
  the standard file format.
- Per-app network attribution (Android `NetworkStatsManager`)
  needs an extra permission; deferred.
- `MeshlitCaptureVpnService` parses IPv4/IPv6 + TCP/UDP headers
  but does not reassemble streams. Long-running flows look like
  many separate packets, which is fine for inspection but not
  for "follow the conversation" use cases.

---

## 8. Known limits of this expanded scope

To stay honest about what's feasible:

- **Fine-tuning is bounded by RAM.** A 7B base model in Q4 (~4 GB) plus
  a LoRA adapter plus optimizer state won't fit on a 6 GB-RAM phone. The
  training UI must refuse to start a job it can't fit and propose
  quantization. This is why the spec runs training on "the most capable
  node in the cluster" — phone-cluster training is a small-model +
  cooperative-memory operation, not a frontier-model operation.
- **HuggingFace private repos need a token.** Storing it locally is fine
  (Android keystore), but the user has to obtain it. Document this.
- **Tailscale on a work-profile / MDM-locked phone** will fail. The
  fallback (WireGuard or plain relay) covers that case; the UI explains
  why.
- **"Export custom training models" can only export what was trained
  locally.** Re-exporting a model that was downloaded and never trained
  is just "copy the GGUF," which already exists.
- **The local firewall is per-listening-socket, not system-wide.** Phones
  can't install a real packet filter without root. State this.
- **No code signing of models.** A user can import a model from anywhere
  and we can't know if it's poisoned. Treat unverified models as
  untrusted input — same as any other file the user chose to download.
## Required real starter model
Before any APK build, run `python3 scripts/prepare-bundled-model.py` from the root.
The asset manifest is revision/SHA/size pinned; Gradle rejects missing or corrupt
weights. Binary models remain ignored by Git. See `app/src/main/assets/models/README.md`.

## Latest continuation priorities (2026-10-06)

Keep genuine phone layer sharding/model execution and committed recovery as the
main product priority. Nodes also contribute storage, tools, capture, sensors,
actuation, preprocessing, DSP, routing and monitoring according to real evidence.
ESP32/Arduino/IoT membership does not imply transformer execution.
Read `../docs/online-power-peripherals-and-configuration.md`,
`../docs/declarative-federation-roadmap.md` and `../docs/media-iot-and-radio-nodes.md`.
These record offline/online selection, free/public/gated model distinctions,
actual pricing provenance, power readings, hardware/vendor backend limits, open
source SSH, configuration transfer, media sources and owner-paired radio carriers.
Keep unsupported adapters visibly unavailable; never invent devices, samples,
throughput, tokens, costs, account entitlements or recovery success.

## Scenario routing and media continuation (2026-10-06)

Read `../docs/model-router-and-media.md`. Scenario recipes, sequential chains/comparisons,
chat text attachments and explicit online vision/image/speech/video adapters are
wired in source. Validate real execution; paid provider media outputs and generic
music/sound/on-device diffusion/video remain separate gates. Do not substitute
text event counts for native tokens. Keep phone layer execution/recovery primary.

## Custom models and training continuation (2026-10-06)

Read [../docs/local-model-behavior-and-training.md](../docs/local-model-behavior-and-training.md). Custom local prompt behavior is default-off;
compatible custom weights are imported through Models. No toggle changes learned
refusals or hosted-provider rules. Settings → Fine-tuning drives the optional
Soup 0.75.0 POSIX host companion via pinned SSH, with real job/status/log/cancel
contracts. Android synthetic gradients are removed; phone autograd reports
unavailable. Actual Soup training, adapter quality/evaluation and GGUF deployment
remain acceptance gates. Keep phone inference layer sharding/recovery primary.
